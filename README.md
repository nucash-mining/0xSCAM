This is the White Paper to SCAM! Even the paper is the wrong color
to be correct. However, the code is immutable. 
SCAM is an ERC-20 token with a limited supply of one. 
Yes, only 1 SCAM! 
[contract address: 0x75b37574C2317CCBA905E2c628d949710627C20A] on 
Altcoinchain.
With such a limited supply of SCAM and the full amount of <1 SCAM>
added to the initial liquidity pool at 1:1 with ALT, it is kind of like
a ponzi, but that does not even matter. What does matter is that you 
get a piece of the SCAM (1 ALT worth) and add all of your SCAM and 1 
ALT (or other token) to the liquidity pool in exchange for an LP token.
Why would you want to be holding some SCAM liquidity, you ask? 
Well, because all liquidity holders of SCAM will receive free mint to 
all future NFTs by the creator of SCAM and also quite possibly airdrops
to future projects, which only the O.G.s of Altcoinchain would receive 
(those who earned ALT on chain id 12345). Yes, if you missed out at the
very beginning of Altcoinchain, you can still be an O.G. by holding 
SCAM liquidity, no matter when, just buy SCAM at any time, then add it 
to liquidity at 1:1 ratio to the amount of SCAM you bought per 1 ALT 
(or other token) and that is your key to the future. If addresses are 
holding any amount of SCAM without being paired with liquidity, those 
addresses are not eligible for free mint and air drops, however that 
could be a way to earn profit in the future with SCAM.
SCAM is definitely ponzi-nomics because the earlier you buy SCAM, 
the larger share of SCAM you will have per ALT (or other token). At 18 
decimal places behind the 1 and only SCAM, the contract can hold quite 
a bit of value in itself.
There is not much to this White Paper other than aforementioned 
facts. There is only 1 SCAM with this contract address. Anything else 
is just a scam.
Have fun!
